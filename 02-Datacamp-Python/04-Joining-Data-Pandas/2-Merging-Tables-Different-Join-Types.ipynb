To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the sequels and financials tables where their index is the movie ID. You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset."
